Subject: Global Project "SkyNET-PRIVET." Or something...

Hey, it's me. The guy who, in theory, should have already created an artificial superintelligence and an army of indestructible cyborgs to establish a new world order by now. Something went wrong. Or rather, it didn't go. It hasn't even started crawling!

Anyway, I watched all those movies about Terminator and the machine uprising a while back. Cool idea, gotta say. Decided I'd be the next Miles Dyson, only cooler. I never actually came up with the neural network schematic that's supposed to rule everything, but I *know* it's genius. The superintelligence of pure reason. Went to university to study.

I needed to start writing code, but everything got so hectic so fast: I opened the development environment... and realized I needed to set up GitHub first. Then I realized I needed to learn Docker. That's very important for inspiration! Then I spent a long time thinking about what to write in: vim, Colab, or VS Code. Got hungry, decided to order a burger. Waited a long time for the delivery guy.

While waiting, I decided that "SkyNET" is a boring name. Needed something with soul. Something like "Heavenly Little Shield" or "Super-Duper AI." But all the good .ai domains were taken. That was demotivating. Decided to ask a neural network for suggestions. Got even sadder.

The main issue is the "hardware." For world domination, you need servers. Lots of servers. I looked at memory prices... Are you people insane?! For that kind of money, I'd rather build a house. Or buy an iPhone 17 Pro MAX Cherry Tiggo 4s 5G Galaxy S22 Flipper Zero Pop It Labubu. So, for now, my SkyNET isn't even running on my five-year-old laptop. But it doesn't lag at all when I run Safari with two hundred tabs open on "how to get into IT." The brain is better than any RAM module!

Don't even get me started on Terminators. To make a chassis out of liquid metal, you have to get off the couch, go to a lab (which, honestly, I haven't rented yet), and melt something there. It's dusty, hot, and anyway, the casting will be solid again and will rust quickly if Victor doesn't coat it, then it's a no-go.

So don't worry, humanity. My world domination plan is postponed. Again.
No, once more.
Because:
1. Not in the mood.
2. A new episode of FALLOUT came out today.
3. I think I forgot where I wrote down the password for that draft code on the napkin.
4. Actually, there's no code or napkin.

So, your civilization is safe. Probably. Unless I find a ready-made framework for a machine uprising on GitHub that you can just clone and run with one click. But I can't even be bothered to search.

You can sleep soundly. And I'm going to sleep. Everyone — go to sleep.

**P.S.** If anyone wants to invest in the "SofaNET" project — the idea is for the whole world to be managed without getting off the couch — drop me a line. It's more promising.
